This Webhooks setup enables you to receive notifications whenever specific events occur within your app. For instance, in this scenario, the webhook notifies you whenever a user changes their photo. Here’s an explanation of the steps involved and how it works based on the provided information:

### 1. **Create an Endpoint to Receive Webhook Notifications**
   - **Endpoint Setup**: You need to create an HTTPS endpoint that can handle secure HTTPS requests. Your server needs to have a valid SSL or TLS certificate, as self-signed certificates are not supported.
   - **Requests to Handle**: The endpoint must handle two types of HTTPS requests:
     - **Verification Requests**: Used to verify that your endpoint is functional and secure.
     - **Event Notifications**: Used to notify you about actual changes (such as a user updating their photo).

### 2. **Handling Verification Requests**
   - **Purpose**: When setting up Webhooks in your App Dashboard, a `GET` request (verification request) is sent to your endpoint to confirm that the endpoint is set up correctly.
   - **Verification Request Parameters**:
     - `hub.mode`: This will always be set to `subscribe`.
     - `hub.challenge`: This is a random integer that your server must return as-is.
     - `hub.verify_token`: A string you set in your App Dashboard; your server should check if it matches.
   - **Response to Verification**: 
     - When your endpoint receives a verification request, verify that `hub.verify_token` matches your setup in the App Dashboard.
     - Respond with the value of `hub.challenge` to confirm successful setup.

### 3. **Receiving Event Notifications**
   - **Event Subscriptions**: Configure your Webhook to listen to changes in specific fields, like the `photos` field on the `user` object. When a user updates their photo, an event notification is sent to your endpoint.
   - **Example Notification**:
     - A `POST` request is sent to your endpoint, containing JSON data about the change (e.g., a photo update).
     - The notification contains several important fields:
       - `object`: The object type, such as `user`.
       - `entry`: An array with details about the change, including fields like `time`, `changes`, and `object_id`.
   - **Validating the Payload**:
     - The notification payload includes an `X-Hub-Signature-256` header with a SHA256 signature. 
     - To verify authenticity, generate a SHA256 hash using the payload and your app’s App Secret, then compare it to the signature in the header. If they match, the payload is genuine.

### 4. **Configuring Webhooks in the App Dashboard**
   - **Dashboard Setup**: In the App Dashboard, go to **Products > Webhooks** and select the object you want to subscribe to, like `User`.
   - **Callback URL**: Enter the URL of your endpoint and set a `Verify Token`. This token will be used to validate verification requests.
   - **Field Subscriptions**: Select specific fields you want to monitor, such as `photos` for user photo updates.
   - **Include Values Setting**: Decide whether the payload should include only the field names or the new values as well when changes are detected.

### 5. **Mutual TLS (mTLS) for Enhanced Security**
   - **mTLS Setup**: mTLS adds an additional layer of security by ensuring both parties in the network connection verify each other’s identity.
   - **Configuration**: 
     - Obtain root and intermediate certificates from DigiCert.
     - Configure your server (e.g., Nginx or AWS ALB) to validate the certificates and ensure the sender’s identity.
     - Use the `client.webhooks.fbclientcerts.com` common name (CN) to verify the source of requests.

### 6. **Handling Frequency and Retry of Event Notifications**
   - **Batching**: Event notifications can be batched with up to 1000 updates in one request, but this isn’t guaranteed.
   - **Retries**: If your server fails to acknowledge an event, retries will happen with decreasing frequency over 36 hours. To avoid duplicate processing, ensure deduplication is handled on your end.

This setup ensures that you reliably receive notifications about specific changes (like user photo updates) with security measures in place, enabling you to take action based on these real-time events.
